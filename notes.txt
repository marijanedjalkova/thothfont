- Andrew Glass's example works in Chrome (img andrewglasschrome) and absolutely does not work in Firefox (img andrewglassff). 
Firefox message: "The character encoding of the HTML document was not declared. The document will render with garbled text 
in some browser configurations if the document contains characters from outside the US-ASCII range. 
The character encoding of the page must be declared in the document or in the transfer protocol."
- In our example:
1. Take .sfd -> prepare_font.py -> .otf/.ttf, .fea 
2. .fea -> feaToVolt.py -> .vtp 
3. Open .otf/.ttf, .vtp in VOLT 
4. Make adjustments 
5. Ship font. 

Doesn't work.
Took myfont1.sfd -> prepare_font.py -> myfontttftest1807.ttf, hiero1test1807.fea
Opened myfontttftest1807.ttf in VOLT, added a substitution rule, shipped to testres1807.otf, the rule doesn't work.

Took a custom created font, customfont.otf (CFF), customfont.ttf, customfont.sfd.
1. Put customfont.otf through VOLT. Names could not be imported, and no glyphs were displayed.
 Shipped to customotfshipped.otf, but the rules didn't work.
2. Put customfont.ttf through VOLT. Glyphs shown, names imported. Rules don't work.
3. customfont.sfd -> prepare_font -> customfont_prepared.ttf
To run the script, changed aux_code_area in constants.py from 500 to 4.
This one is not even showing anything. 

In the email I say that I worked with a .ttf file. Tried but fontforge produces fonts that, 
when viewed in Windows, show only "TrueType Outlines", not "OpenType Layout, TrueType Outlines."

The problem was the name of the script. It works if it is "Latin <latn>". Proof is when
created testshipped.otf from ttftest.ttf.

However, the main project still doesn't work. 
Created customfont1907.ttf. And the test worked in VOLT. 
customfont1907.ttf -> prepare_font.py -> hierotest1907custom.fea, customfont1907_prepared.ttf.

customfont1907_prepared.ttf doesn't pass the test - when opened in VOLT, no glyphs showing, even the ones that were there initially. 
The names get imported, but asterisk does not exist. Some glyphs missing? There are 548 of them. Need to check fontforge for how many of them there are.
Opening in fontforge, but really hard to see how many glyphs. No images showing. 

Should try with the original prepare_font.

Abandoned working on this, tested myfont.ttf with VOLT and it worked.
Using prepare_font_orig created a .ttf which works, and importing projfile.vtp also makes it compile. Still need to finish the positional lookups though.
